                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important and widely celebrated festivals in
                    India. <br>
                    The word Deepavali means "a row of lamps" in Sanskrit. It symbolizes the victory of light over
                    darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. <br>
                    The festival usually lasts for five days, with the main celebration on the third day, known as
                    Lakshmi Puja, when people worship Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. <br>
                    During Diwali, homes and streets are beautifully decorated with diyas (oil lamps), candles, and
                    colorful rangolis. People wear new clothes, exchange sweets and gifts, and light fireworks to mark
                    the joyous occasion. <br>
                    Spiritually, Diwali also marks the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king
                    Ravana, as told in the epic Ramayana. <br>
                    Beyond religion, Diwali brings people together — spreading messages of hope, unity, and positivity.
                    <br>
                    It’s a time for renewal, forgiveness, and new beginnings.
